     * You are playing a solitaire game with three piles of stones of sizes a​​​​​​, b,​​​​​​ and c​​​​​​ respectively. Each turn you choose two different non-empty piles, take one stone from each, and add 1 point to your score. The game stops when there are fewer than two non-empty piles (meaning there are no more available moves).
       Given three integers a​​​​​, b,​​​​​ and c​​​​​, return the maximum score you can get.

        Constraints:
        1 <= a, b, c <= 10^5
        Example:
            Input: a = 2, b = 4, c = 6
            Output: 6
            Explanation: The starting state is (2, 4, 6). One optimal set of moves is:
            - Take from 1st and 3rd piles, state is now (1, 4, 5)
            - Take from 1st and 3rd piles, state is now (0, 4, 4)
            - Take from 2nd and 3rd piles, state is now (0, 3, 3)
            - Take from 2nd and 3rd piles, state is now (0, 2, 2)
            - Take from 2nd and 3rd piles, state is now (0, 1, 1)
            - Take from 2nd and 3rd piles, state is now (0, 0, 0)
            There are fewer than two non-empty piles, so the game ends. Total: 6 points.
